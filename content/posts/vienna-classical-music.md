## The Drive from Prague to Vienna

The journey from Prague to Vienna was one of our most scenic drives yet. The Austrian countryside unfolded before us as we crossed the border, with rolling hills and charming villages dotting the landscape. Our Tesla's navigation system guided us perfectly through the winding roads.

## Vienna's EV Infrastructure

Vienna impressed us with its commitment to sustainable transportation. The city has invested heavily in EV charging infrastructure:

- **Public charging stations** every few blocks
- **Tesla Superchargers** at multiple locations
- **Hotel charging** widely available
- **Parking benefits** for electric vehicles

We charged at the Vienna Central Station Supercharger, which was conveniently located near our hotel.

## A Day of Classical Music

No visit to Vienna would be complete without experiencing its rich musical heritage. We attended a performance at the Vienna State Opera House, where Mozart and Beethoven once performed.

### Musical Highlights
- **Vienna State Opera** - Magnificent architecture and world-class performances
- **Musikverein** - Home of the Vienna Philharmonic
- **House of Music** - Interactive museum celebrating Vienna's musical history
- **Street musicians** - Talented performers throughout the city

## Coffee Culture Deep Dive

Vienna's coffee house culture is legendary, and we made it our mission to experience as many as possible:

1. **Café Central** - Historic and elegant, a must-visit
2. **Café Hawelka** - Traditional Viennese atmosphere
3. **Café Sperl** - Local favorite with authentic charm
4. **Café Demel** - Famous for its pastries and confections

Each coffee house had its own character, but they all shared the tradition of slow, contemplative coffee drinking.

## Schönbrunn Palace

The former imperial summer residence was a highlight of our visit. We spent an entire day exploring the palace gardens and learning about the Habsburg dynasty. The Tesla looked surprisingly at home parked near the palace gates!

### Palace Highlights
- **Grand Tour** of the imperial apartments
- **Garden maze** - Fun and challenging
- **Gloriette** - Stunning views over Vienna
- **Palm House** - Exotic plants and flowers

## Tesla Charging in Vienna

Vienna's charging network is exemplary:

- **Supercharger locations**: 4 within city limits
- **Charging speed**: Up to 250kW
- **Availability**: Excellent, rarely had to wait
- **Cost**: Competitive with other European cities

## Photography in Vienna

Vienna offers endless photographic opportunities:

- **Architectural details** on every building
- **Street scenes** in the historic center
- **Tesla integration** with classical architecture
- **Sunset views** from various viewpoints

## Cultural Insights

Vienna taught us about the importance of taking time to appreciate art, music, and culture. The city's slower pace compared to other European capitals was refreshing, and we found ourselves adopting the Viennese approach to life.

## Next Destination

From Vienna, we're heading south to the beautiful city of Salzburg, birthplace of Mozart. The 300km journey will take us through the stunning Austrian Alps, where we'll test our Tesla's performance on mountain roads.
