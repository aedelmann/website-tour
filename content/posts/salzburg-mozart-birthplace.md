## Mountain Driving with the Tesla

The drive from Vienna to Salzburg through the Austrian Alps was our most challenging yet. The winding mountain roads and elevation changes put our Tesla Model Y to the test, but it performed flawlessly. The regenerative braking on downhill sections was particularly impressive, actually adding range to our battery!

### Alpine Driving Stats
- **Elevation gain**: 1,200 meters
- **Energy efficiency**: 22 kWh/100km (due to mountain driving)
- **Regenerative braking**: Gained 15km of range on descents
- **Charging stop**: Tesla Supercharger in Linz

## Mozart's Birthplace

Salzburg is synonymous with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and visiting his birthplace was a profound experience. The small house on Getreidegasse has been preserved exactly as it was when the musical genius was born there in 1756.

### Mozart-Related Sites
1. **Mozart's Birthplace** - Original house with family artifacts
2. **Mozart's Residence** - Where he lived as an adult
3. **Mozart Square** - Central statue and meeting point
4. **Salzburg Cathedral** - Where Mozart was baptized

## Hohensalzburg Fortress

Perched high above the city, the Hohensalzburg Fortress offers the best views of Salzburg and the surrounding Alps. We took the funicular up and spent hours exploring the medieval fortress and its museums.

### Fortress Highlights
- **Medieval architecture** - 900 years of history
- **Panoramic views** - Stunning Alpine vistas
- **Museum collections** - Medieval artifacts and art
- **Concert hall** - Regular classical music performances

## Tesla Charging in the Alps

Salzburg's charging infrastructure was surprisingly good for a smaller city:

- **Tesla Supercharger** at the main shopping center
- **Destination charging** at several hotels
- **Public charging** throughout the old town
- **Mountain charging** at ski resorts (seasonal)

## Sound of Music Tour

Yes, we did it! The Sound of Music tour was touristy but absolutely worth it. We visited filming locations and learned about the real von Trapp family story.

### Tour Highlights
- **Mirabell Gardens** - "Do-Re-Mi" song location
- **Hellbrunn Palace** - Gazebo scene
- **Mondsee** - Wedding church location
- **Werfen** - "Edelweiss" mountain scenes

## Alpine Photography

The combination of historic architecture and Alpine scenery made for incredible photography:

- **Fortress silhouettes** against mountain backdrops
- **Tesla charging** with Alpine views
- **Traditional architecture** in the old town
- **Sunset over the Alps** from various viewpoints

## Local Cuisine

Salzburg's food scene combines Austrian tradition with Alpine influences:

- **Salzburger Nockerl** - The city's signature dessert
- **Kaiserschmarrn** - Traditional Austrian pancake
- **Alpine cheese** - Local dairy specialties
- **Beer culture** - Excellent local breweries

## EV Performance in Mountains

Our Tesla handled the Alpine driving exceptionally well:

- **Regenerative braking** on descents
- **Instant torque** for mountain passes
- **Stable handling** on winding roads
- **Energy efficiency** better than expected

## Cultural Immersion

Salzburg taught us about the intersection of music, history, and nature. The city's commitment to preserving its cultural heritage while embracing modern technology (like EVs) was inspiring.

## Next Adventure

From Salzburg, we're heading west to Munich, Germany. This 150km journey will take us through some of the most beautiful Alpine scenery, and we're excited to experience Germany's famous Autobahn with our Tesla!

*Follow our journey as we continue exploring Europe's most beautiful destinations in our electric vehicle. The mountains have been incredible, and we can't wait to see what Germany has in store!*
