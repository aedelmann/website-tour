Hey everyone! If you've been following our nomadic adventures, you know we kicked off the new year in style. After ringing in New Year's in vibrant Malaga, we decided it was time to upgrade from hotel-hopping to something a bit more... permanent-ish. Enter: Torremolinos.

First things first—getting there was ridiculously easy. We hopped on Spain's high-speed AVE train from Madrid to Malaga (a breezy 3.5 hours—faster than some of my family arguments), then grabbed an Uber to our temporary home in La Colina, Torremolinos. Boom. Two months of coastal living secured. For context on where we landed (and where we're headed next), here's a handy map of southern Spain's Andalusia region showing Malaga (and nearby Torremolinos on the Costa del Sol) and Jerez de la Frontera down in Cádiz province:

{{< andalusia_map src="/images/torremolinos/map-malaga-jerez.png" alt="Map of Andalusia with Malaga, Torremolinos, and Jerez de la Frontera circled" >}}

(That's Torremolinos right on the coast near Malaga, and Jerez a couple of hours southwest—perfect for our upcoming move!)

## Torremolinos in winter? Mild doesn't even cover it.

We're talking 12–21°C swings that feel like the weather is having an identity crisis. One minute it's glorious sunshine (shorts weather!), the next it's pouring rain and whipping winds strong enough to turn your balcony furniture into a launch pad. We've had nights where the gusts rattled the windows so hard we debated whether to sleep or just hold on for dear life. Pro tip: earplugs are the real MVPs here.

## The food. Oh my tapas-loving heart.

Fresh seafood, perfectly crispy paella, endless plates of jamón, and local wines or ice-cold cervezas that somehow taste better with every bite. The best part? A full meal out—including drinks—rarely tops €20 per person. In Germany we'd pay that for a sad sandwich and tap water. Here? We're basically living like foodie royalty on a budget. We've become those people who "just pop out for a quick tapa" and come back three hours later, slightly tipsy and very happy.

## The locals? Super friendly and supportive.

Everyone greets you like an old friend, even when you're mangling basic Spanish phrases. Speaking of which, most people speak some English... just enough to make you think you can get by without trying. Spoiler: you can't. So we're slowly (very slowly) learning Spanish. Nothing bonds a couple like arguing over whether "quiero" means "I want" or accidentally ordering three extra beers.

Torremolinos itself is surprisingly clean and safe—unlike certain places we've lived where you triple-check your bike lock. Public transport is another win: €0.70 per trip to zip into Malaga. Efficient, cheap, and no drama. We've been keeping fit too—hitting a nearby gym 4–5 times a week for just €40 per person per month. Who knew sweating could feel this affordable?

## Adulting hard: Tesla order and visa battles.

Amid all this bliss, we've been adulting hard. We placed an order for a shiny new Tesla (estimated delivery end of March—fingers crossed no more public transport adventures soon). More importantly, we're deep in the trenches of Cristyne's visa process. Spanish bureaucracy is like a video game on expert mode: endless paperwork, surprise requirements, and occasional "why not?" moments. We're fighting the good fight and hoping everything clears by late March or early April. Send good vibes (and maybe some sangria).

## Next chapter: Jerez de la Frontera.

The biggest news? We've found our next chapter. A brand-new apartment in Jerez de la Frontera (Cádiz province), complete with garage, for just €700/month. It's about 2.5 hours south of here—far enough for sherry country vibes, close enough that we won't miss the Costa del Sol entirely. We'll pack up and head there at the beginning of March. More stories (and probably more tapas disasters) coming soon—stay tuned!

## Key takeaways and tips

1. **Budget:** You can comfortably live on €3,000 per month for two people in Spain—including rent and health insurance.
2. **Street smarts:** Learn how to spot dog poop on the street :)
3. **Rentals:** Watch out for scammers when finding an apartment. Do your checks and never pay large sums or share personal documents before viewing or signing.
4. **Spanish bureaucracy:** Bring extra time (and patience). Register for the [Cl@ve system](https://www.sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/) (similar to Singapore’s Singpass) so you can handle many procedures online instead of queuing in person.
5. **Empadronamiento:** Register your residency (*empadronamiento*) very early—it can take several weeks or even months to be approved, and you’ll need it for other paperwork.

For now, we're soaking up every sunny (and windy) moment in Torremolinos. Life's too short not to enjoy cheap paella, friendly strangers, and the occasional gale-force wind trying to yeet you off the balcony.

*Hasta luego, amigos!*
