## Starting Our European Adventure

After months of planning, Cristyne and I finally began our world tour in Prague, the beautiful capital of the Czech Republic. Our Tesla Model Y Long Range made the journey effortlessly from our starting point, and we were excited to explore this historic city.

## The Journey to Prague

The drive to Prague was smooth, with our Tesla's Autopilot making highway driving a breeze. We made one quick charging stop at a Tesla Supercharger station near the border, which gave us a chance to stretch our legs and grab some coffee.

### Charging Experience
- **Location**: Tesla Supercharger Brno
- **Charging Time**: 25 minutes
- **Energy Added**: 45 kWh
- **Cost**: €18.50

## Exploring Prague's Architecture

Prague is a photographer's dream, with stunning Gothic and Baroque architecture around every corner. We spent our first day walking through the Old Town, marveling at the intricate details of buildings that have stood for centuries.

### Must-See Locations
1. **Charles Bridge** - The iconic bridge offers breathtaking views of the Vltava River
2. **Prague Castle** - The largest ancient castle complex in the world
3. **Old Town Square** - Home to the famous Astronomical Clock
4. **Petřín Hill** - Perfect for panoramic city views

## Tesla-Friendly Prague

One of our concerns was finding charging stations in Prague, but we were pleasantly surprised. The city has excellent EV infrastructure:

- Multiple Supercharger locations
- Destination charging at hotels
- Public charging stations throughout the city

Our hotel even had a Tesla Wall Connector, making overnight charging convenient and free.

## Culinary Adventures

Prague's food scene exceeded our expectations. We discovered:

- **Traditional Czech cuisine** at Lokál
- **Modern fusion** at Café Savoy
- **Street food** at Havelská Market
- **Craft beer** at U Fleků

## Photography Tips

For fellow travelers with cameras:

- Golden hour at Charles Bridge is magical
- The castle complex offers multiple vantage points
- Early morning walks avoid crowds
- Don't forget to capture the Tesla at iconic locations!

## What's Next

Tomorrow we're heading to Vienna, Austria. The 330km journey should take about 4 hours with one charging stop. We're excited to explore another beautiful European capital!
