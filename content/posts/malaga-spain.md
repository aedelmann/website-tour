## Arriving in Málaga

We took the train from Madrid on New Year's Day and arrived in Málaga, the capital of the Costa del Sol. Known for its beaches, museums, and birthplace of Picasso, Málaga is the perfect gateway to Andalucía.

## What We're Exploring

From the Alcazaba fortress to the vibrant Mercado Central, we're soaking up the Mediterranean vibe and preparing for the next leg of our journey. Stay tuned for more updates from the south of Spain.
